# Kaggle-Wine-quality-project
This repository contains the code and analysis for the Wine Quality Prediction project, where we explore and predict the quality of wine using machine learning techniques. The project leverages a dataset from Kaggle and demonstrates data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and model building using Python.
