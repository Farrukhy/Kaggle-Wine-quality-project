Kaggle-Wine-Quality-Project

Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for the Wine Quality Prediction project, where we explore and predict the quality of wine using machine learning techniques. The project leverages a dataset from Kaggle and demonstrates data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and model building using Python.

Project Structure

- `clean_df()` Function: This custom function is used to clean the dataset by removing entries that appear less frequently than a specified threshold. This helps in reducing noise and ensuring that the model is trained on more significant data points.

- 'data_analysis()` Function: This function performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) by visualizing the distribution of values within a specified column. The visualization is done using Matplotlib, and key statistics are displayed on the bar plots.

- Modeling: 
  - Data Imputation: Missing values in the dataset are handled using `SimpleImputer` from Scikit-Learn, which fills in missing values with the mean of the respective feature.
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier: The core of the prediction task is handled by a `GradientBoostingClassifier`, a powerful machine learning model that is trained on the imputed dataset.

- Evaluation: The model’s performance is evaluated using the accuracy score metric, providing an indication of how well the model predicts the quality of wine.

Key Features

- Data Cleaning: An intuitive approach to removing less frequent values from the dataset, which can help in improving the model’s performance.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizations that provide insights into the distribution and characteristics of different features within the dataset.
- Machine Learning: Implementation of a Gradient Boosting model to predict wine quality, with performance evaluation.

 Results

The model achieves an accuracy of `X.XXX`, indicating its effectiveness in predicting wine quality based on the available features.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains various chemical properties of wines, including acidity, sugar content, and alcohol levels, which are used to predict the quality of wine.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning to build a predictive model. It serves as a practical example of applying these techniques to a real-world dataset.
